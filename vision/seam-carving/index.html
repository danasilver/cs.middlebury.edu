        <h4>Goals and Summary</h4>
        <p>
          Our goal was to implement a functional version of seam carving as
          described in the
          <a href="http://www.faculty.idc.ac.il/arik/SCWeb/imret/imret.pdf">paper</a>
          by Avidan and Shamir. Our implementation is able to retarget images to
          a smaller size both horizontally and verically.
        </p>
        <p>
          We approached the problem as described in the paper, by calculating
          an energy function over the image, then using a dynamic programming
          procedure to calculate the cumulative minimum energies either
          vertically or horizontally. We backtrack through this array of
          cumulative minimum energies produced by the dynamic programming
          algorithm to find the seam of minimum energy that we remove from the
          image.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the size and energy of the image has changed after each seam
          removal, we recalculate energy, the paths of minimum energy, and the
          seam to remove after each seam removal operation in either direction.
        </p>
      </section>

        <h4>Implementation</h4>

        <h5>Usage</h5>

        <p>
          Our implementation supports content aware image reduction. There are
          two modes, one of which is interactive and resizes based on a mouse
          click in the image. The non-interactive mode takes two input values,
          the width and height to resize to. The interactive mode opens the
          image in a window and allow the user to click on the image to
          determine the dimensions to resize the image to.
        </p>

        <p>
          Both modes animate the seam removal, drawing each seam before
          removing it and then drawing the final image. Any key can be pressed
          to close the window containing the final image.
        </p>

        <p>Non-interactive:</p>

        <pre><code>$ python seamcarve.py image_name width height</code></pre>

        <p>Interactive:</p>

        <pre><code>$ python seamcarve.py image_name --interactive</code></pre>

          All code and images are available on GitHub at
          <a href="https://github.com/danasilver/seam-carving">
            danasilver/seam-carving</a>.
        </p>

        <h5>Energy function</h5>

        <p>
          We start processing the image to calculate the energy function by
          applying a Gaussian filter with a 3 by 3 kernel and standard deviation
          of 0 to blur the image and reduce noise. We convert the image to
          to greyscale before using Sobel filters to compute the image gradients
          in x and y directions from the blurred image.

          Each Sobel filter convolved weighted 3x3
          kernels to approximate the x and y gradients. As Sobel filters are
          discrete differentiation operators, the x gradient and y gradient are
          calculated separately. The gradients from the Sobel filters produces
          images with higher intensity values along edges within the image by
          taking the image's derivative. We take the absolute value of the
          derivatives in the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> directions and sum them
          to get the final energy function.

        <h5>Seam Calculation with Dynamic Programming</h5>

        <p>
          We use a dynamic programming procedure to compute the cumulative
          energies in the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> directions. To remove a column
          of pixels and make the image one fewer pixels wide, we start in the
          second row, and iterate through the pixels from left to right. In each
          cell of our cumulative energies table we record the sum of the energy
          at that pixel and the minimum of the three 8-connected pixels above.

        <p>
          The backtracking step, seen in the third diagram above, starts in the
          last row of cumulative energies computed with dynamic programming
          and selects the pixel with the minimum value. From that pixel the
          backtracking algorithm works up the image row by row selecting the
          pixel from the three 8-connected pixels above the previous one with
          the minimum value. This is the pixel that produced the path of
          minimum energy.
        </p>

        <p>
          The result of this backtracking is vertical path from the top to
          bottom of the image with one pixel selected for the seam in each row.
          When remove the pixels on the seam the image is exactly one pixel
          less in the x direction. The algorithm works similarly to find a
          horizontal seam and remove pixels in the y direction. Instead of
          choosing between the minimum of the three pixels to the top, the
          algorithm chooses between the three to the left as it moves across
          columns of the image.

        <h4>Results</h4>

        <h5>Beach</h5>

        <p>
          The <i>beach</i> image, as seen above performs well when seam carved.
          The background, mainly blue ocean and gray sand creates a low energy
          background, so the seam finding algorithm is easily able to
          differentiate between the foreground (girl and bird) and the
          background. As seen in the seam carving animation, few cuts pass
          through the foreground in either direction.

        <h5>Giro</h5>

        <p>
          The <i>giro</i> image poses a challenge to seam carve since it has
          a high energy background. The energy function, seen below, has a hard
          time differentiating between the foreground and background in some
          areas, particularly the left arm (on the right of the image) of the
          rider in pink. The area between his arm and the background is
          calculated as low-energy, and in the retargted image below his arm
          is cut off. We only resized this image width-wise since the rider
          in pink takes up almost the entire image height-wise.
